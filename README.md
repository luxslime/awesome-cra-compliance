The CRA is the first EU-wide horizontal regulation setting mandatory cybersecurity requirements for all hardware and software products with digital elements placed on the Union market. It entered into force on **10 December 2024**, its vulnerability-reporting duties start **11 September 2026**, and its full requirements apply from **11 December 2027**. This list gathers the most useful public resources for engineers, assessors, lawyers, and managers working on CRA compliance.

> **Disclaimer**: This list curates and describes publicly available resources related to the EU Cyber Resilience Act. Copyrighted materials (ISO/IEC, ETSI, BSI, IEEE standards, and published books) are linked to their **official catalogue pages only** — no copyrighted content is hosted in this repository. The PDFs stored in `presentations/` and `docs/eu/` are either (a) official EU publications published under the Commission's reuse policy (Decision 2011/833/EU), or (b) webinar slide decks released publicly by CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, ENISA, or other EU projects.

## Standards & Standardisation

### M/606 Standardisation Request

The M/606 mandate defines **40+ harmonised standards** — 4 horizontal (applicable to all products) and 36+ vertical (per product category). Compliance with a harmonised standard creates a presumption of conformity with the CRA essential requirements it covers (Art. 27).

## Conformity Assessment & Certification

### EUCC (Common Criteria)

For critical products (Annex IV: HSMs, smart-meter gateways, smartcards) and optionally for important products, EUCC certification at "substantial" assurance level provides a presumption of conformity with CRA essential requirements (Art. 27(8)-(9)).

## Vulnerability Handling & Reporting

### SBOM & Transparency

CRA Annex I Part II (1) obliges manufacturers to identify and document the components and vulnerabilities in their products, including through a software bill of materials. The draft horizontal harmonised standard **prEN 40000-1-3** (CEN/CLC JTC 13) gives that obligation operational shape through normative requirements in clauses 5.3.8 (software) and 5.3.9 (hardware); for authoritative wording, consult the published draft from your national standards body.

| ID | What the requirement covers (paraphrased) |
|----|-------------------------------------------|
| `[PRE-7-RQ-01]` | Every software component in the product must be inventoried and documented. |
| `[PRE-7-RQ-03]` | Direct dependencies are mandatory; indirect (transitive) dependencies are recommended. |
| `[PRE-7-RQ-04]` | The SBOM has to be machine-readable; SPDX and CycloneDX are the formats explicitly named. |
| `[PRE-7-RQ-06]` | SBOM metadata must include author, version, and ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `[PRE-7-RQ-07]` | Each component requires a unique identifier — PURL, CPE, and SWHID are given as examples. |
| `[PRE-7-RQ-07-RE]` | Where an upstream vendor supplies a component hash, it must be carried through into the SBOM. |
| `[PRE-8-RQ-02]` | Hardware must also be inventoried: producer, component name, identifier, and firmware version where applicable. |
| `[RLS-2-RQ-03-RE]` | After a vulnerability is fixed, the disclosure must be issued in a machine-readable advisory format; CSAF v2.0 (ISO/IEC 20153:2025) is the named reference. |

## Relationship to Other EU Regulation

The CRA does not sit in isolation. These neighbouring regimes carve out, pre-empt, or overlap with CRA obligations.

- [NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj) - Covers essential and important *entities*. CRA covers *products*. Many manufacturers fall under both. NIS2 incident reporting (Art. 23) and CRA Art. 14 reporting run in parallel.
- [Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU & Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/30](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/electrical-engineering/red-directive_en) - RED cybersecurity requirements apply until 11 December 2027; then repealed in favour of the CRA. Local copy of the repeal act: [`docs/eu/red-delegated-act-repeal.pdf`](docs/eu/red-delegated-act-repeal.pdf).
- [Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 — AI Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj) - Art. 8 CRA coordinates with AI Act: products that are both high-risk AI systems and PDEs follow AI Act's conformity route, which CRA considers satisfied.
- [Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 — Machinery Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/oj) - Cybersecurity of safety-related machinery components. CRA generally excludes items covered by sector-specific cybersecurity rules (Art. 2(2)).
- [Regulation (EU) 2017/745 — Medical Devices (MDR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/oj) - Excluded from CRA scope (Art. 2(2)(a)); MDR cybersecurity applies.
- [Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 — Vehicle General Safety](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2144/oj) and [UN R155](https://unece.org/transport/documents/2021/03/standards/un-regulation-no-155-cyber-security-and-cyber-security) - Vehicle cybersecurity is out of CRA scope; UN R155 + WP.29 apply instead.
- [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) - Data-protection complement. Security-of-processing (Art. 32 GDPR) and CRA essential requirements interact for any product processing personal data.
- [Cybersecurity Act (EU) 2019/881](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj) - Framework under which the EUCC scheme is established; referenced by CRA Art. 8 and Art. 27(8)-(9).
